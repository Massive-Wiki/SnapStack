# IPNS name

In early versions of SnapStack, there was a presumption that IPNS would be used to advertise a folio using a persistent name (the IPNS address).

It turns out that IPNS may not be practical yet, because it needs to be persistently republished, and there isn't easily available commodity support for that.

See more discussion of IPNS and other options in [[Persistent Folio Name]].
