# SnapStack

⚠️ PRE-RELEASE

A lightweight workflow for small teams to collaboratively maintain document collections ("folios") using IPFS.

The current work is evolving, and the documents herein might look finished, but they are not. There will be conflicts inter-doc, and maybe even intra-doc.

See the [[blogs]] folder for running commentary.

We haven't automated yet, so this may be incomplete, but here is the [[CID Stack]] for this folio.

## Documents

- [[SnapStack v0.9.1-2025-09-03-002]] - most recent combined version
- [[SnapStack - Collaborative Writing, Stacked as Immutable Snapshots]] - early version, still some of the clearest writing about the overall idea

## Older Documents

- [[SnapStack v0.8.0-2025-08-29]]
